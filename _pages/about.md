Wolverine Robotics was founded in 2025 by two students: Abdullah and Dev. While they both had a passion for FIRST, having participated in FRC and FTC for multiple years, they recognized the importance of increasing the access to STEM in our community, especially since many FIRST teams do not have the time nor resources to train new students. As such, they created Wolverine Robotics in cooperation with the Wakeland High School administration, working overtime to get us ready for our first competition a mere 11 days after forming the team! 
Since then, we've been able to improve on our design, programming, and driving skills whilst simultaneously improving our students' capabilities through online trainings and in-person meetings, expanding our team's reach both in our school and in the community.
