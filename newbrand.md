## **3. Implementation Guide**

### **The "Voltage" Pop**

Because **Voltage Orange** is extremely vibrant, use it sparingly in the portfolio to avoid "eye strain" for the judges.

* **DO:** Use it for the outline of your "W" logo or to circle a critical component in a robot photo.
* **DON'T:** Use it for large blocks of body text.

### **The "Steel" Precision**

Use **Steel Grey** to bridge the gap between your heavy Navy and bright Orange.

* **Portfolio Tip:** Use Steel Grey for your "Iteration Numbers" or "Dates" in your engineering logs. It keeps the page organized without distracting from the main engineering content.

# **Wolverine Robotics Style Guide Addendum**

**FTC Team 33791 | Section 5: Visual Motifs & Graphics**

## **1. Geometric Logic: The 45° Rule**

To maintain consistency with the sharp, aggressive "W" logo, all graphic elements must prioritize **Angles over Curves**.

* **The Angle:** Use **45-degree cuts** for corner treatments, buttons, and photo borders.
* **The Shape:** Favor triangles and chevrons as directional pointers.
* **Implementation:** Instead of a standard rectangular text box, "clip" one corner at a 45-degree angle to create a custom technical look.

## **2. Pattern: The "Wolverine Claw"**

This is your primary background motif. It adds texture without distracting from your engineering data.

* **The Design:** Three parallel diagonal lines (slanted at 45 degrees).
* **Usage:**
* **Page Borders:** Run the "Claw" along the bottom right corner of every page in **Steel Grey**.
* **Section Breaks:** Use them to separate headers from body text.
* **Watermarks:** Use large, low-opacity (5–10%) Claw Marks behind your **Midnight Navy** title pages.



## **3. Aesthetic: The Blueprint Overlay**

This technique directly connects your portfolio to your actual robot build.

* **The Strategy:** Take a wireframe export from your CAD software (Onshape/SolidWorks).
* **The Execution:** * Place a **White wireframe** on top of a **Midnight Navy** background.
* Lower the opacity of the wireframe so it sits "behind" your text.
* **Result:** A professional "Blueprint" look that reinforces your technical expertise to the judges.

## **Revised Visual Identity Table**

| Component | Brand Application | Recommended Element |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Borders** | Claw Marks | Three diagonal lines in **Steel Grey** |
| **Buttons** | The 45° Cut | Rectangles with one clipped corner |
| **Icons** | Geometric / Angular | Avoid rounded edges; use sharp vertices |
| **Diagrams** | Blueprint Style | White wireframes on **Midnight Navy** |

## **Final Branding Checklist**

* [ ] Are there any "soft" circles that should be replaced with **Hexagons** or **Octagons**?
* [ ] Does every page have the **Claw Mark** border in the footer?
* [ ] Are the CAD drawings presented as **Blueprints** on the main section headers?

**Would you like me to create a "Front Cover" layout description for your portfolio using the Blueprint and Claw Mark motifs?**
